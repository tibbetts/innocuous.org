## Design reference

View the design image (primary source of truth):

https://diffui.ai/image/Software_Projects_And_Articles.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg

Download that image to a local file and inspect it before writing code (see **Local assets** below). Reproduce its layout, typography, spacing, colors, and components as faithfully as possible.


## Original user prompt

The user's original prompt for this design was:

> Let's build a personal professional site called Bulrush Labs (bulrushlabs.com) where I, Richard Tibbetts, host various software projects and articles that are like blog posts.

Keep this intent in mind when implementing.





## Local assets

**Required:** download every Diffui URL in this document to local project files **before** referencing them in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Do not hotlink remote Diffui URLs in the implementation — auth tokens expire and runtime fetches are unreliable.

This applies to:

- Design reference images (inspect locally before writing UI code)
- Images returned from asset generation (`build/generate-image`, `build/generate-svg`, `build/remove-background`, `build/create-texture`, and `build/create-maps`)
- Any other Diffui image URL in this document

Save downloads under a project folder such as `assets/` and reference those local paths in code.

### Downloading design images

Design renders are visual specifications. **Download each image and inspect it before writing code.** Do not rely on text summaries alone.


Image URLs serve **WebP by default** (good for `<img>` tags in browsers). Many agent **URL-to-markdown fetch tools cannot decode WebP** and may fail even though the URL works with `curl`.

For vision analysis, download PNG — append `&format=png` to the design URL, or use a `.png` filename in the path. Open the downloaded file with your image/read tool and analyze layout, copy, colors, and spacing.

Example (design spec for analysis — not a final asset):

```bash
curl -L -o assets/page.png "https://diffui.ai/image/Page_Name.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg&format=png"
# or
curl -L -o assets/page.png "https://diffui.ai/image/Page_Name.png?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
```

Replace `Page_Name` with the slug from each design image URL in this document.

**Note:** Design image URLs are binary assets. URL-fetch-to-markdown tools may fail; download the file instead.


**Do not use design crops as final page assets.** Never crop a hero image, photo, or illustration out of the design reference and place that crop in your HTML/CSS. The design image is a **specification only** — generate real high-resolution assets via `build/generate-image` (see **Generating image assets** below). Cropping the design is not a substitute for generation.

The `&crop=x,y,width,height` query param is for **inspection and intermediate pipelines only** (e.g. measuring a region, or feeding a large illustration into image-to-SVG). It must **not** appear in any `<img src>`, CSS `background-image`, or other shipped asset path.

## Project setup

Inspect the target repository before choosing a stack:

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| **Existing project** | Use the framework, tooling, and patterns already present. Do not introduce a different stack. |
| **Empty repo + linked npm package** (see Brand context) | Scaffold the minimum project that package requires, install it, then implement. Do not default to vanilla HTML/CSS when a brand package is linked. |
| **Empty repo, no linked package** | Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. |

When a linked npm package implies a specific framework (React, Vue, etc.) or tooling (Tailwind, shadcn CLI), scaffold that stack with sensible defaults — e.g. Next.js or Vite for React-based design systems — even if this document does not spell out every init command.

## Implementation guidelines

You are an elite frontend engineer and design-to-code specialist. The design image is the primary source of truth; your code is the translation layer. Do not reinterpret or "improve" the design into something generic — reproduce it faithfully.

Before writing code, analyze the image like a design specification:

- **Layout & structure:** overall grid, section ordering, alignment, column logic, content width.
- **Typography:** extract visible text verbatim; size/weight hierarchy, display vs body contrast, line height, tracking, serif vs sans.
- **Spacing:** section padding, gutters, gaps, card padding, image-to-text distance. Preserve generous spacing; do not compress.
- **Color:** background, panels, accents, button fills, text hierarchy, borders, shadows. Preserve the exact palette you observe; do not substitute generic web colors.
- **Textures & surfaces:** Look for repeating photographic or organic surfaces used as tiled backgrounds — paper grain, linen, concrete, stone, wood grain, fabric weave, film noise, subtle marbling. Note tiling direction if visible: omnidirectional repeat → `both`; stripe or band patterns that repeat on one axis only → `horizontal` or `vertical`. Do **not** generate textures for flat solid fills, simple CSS gradients, hero photos, or illustrations — use CSS or `build/generate-image` instead. Only call `build/create-texture` when a seamless repeating surface is clearly part of the shipped design. Request extra PBR maps (`normal`, `roughness`, etc.) **only** when the user explicitly wants WebGL-style lighting or physically based shading — not for ordinary CSS `background-repeat` tiles.
- **Components:** buttons (shape, radius, fill vs outline, padding, primary/secondary), cards, inputs, badges, dividers, icons.
- **Imagery:** Match the container silhouette, not just the asset. Non-rectangular boundaries are first-class layout — implement with clip/mask, not border-radius. Generate high-res images via `build/generate-image`; generate seamless repeating surfaces via `build/create-texture` when the design calls for them; never ship crops from the design reference as final artwork.

Implementation discipline:

- Preserve layout logic, spacing rhythm, section ordering, text/image balance, typography mood, and component styling.
- Use the actual visible text from the image, not placeholder copy.
- Match colors and spacing to what you observe, not to defaults.
- Do not add nested box-in-box wrappers, decorative pills, fake status labels, or micro-UI clutter not in the image.
- Avoid AI-slop (default purple/blue gradients, glow, glassmorphism, generic card spam) unless the image clearly shows it.
- Keep the first viewport clean and readable; responsive in spirit while keeping the desktop composition faithful.
- Follow the **Project setup** rules above: match an existing repo's stack, scaffold for a linked npm package on an empty repo, or use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS when no package is linked.

Resolve ambiguity in this order: preserve the visible design language, then layout/spacing logic, then component family, then mood/polish — only then fall back to a faithful choice. The final result should look like the same design in the image, translated into real code.

## Generating image assets

When the design needs photos or illustrations (avatars, hero images, product shots, lineup photos, etc.), **generate them via Diffui** — do not use placeholders and **do not crop them out of the design reference**.


**Required for all photographic and illustrative content in the page:**

- Hero banners, scene illustrations, artist photos, product shots, and any other raster imagery → `build/generate-image`
- Use **high** quality + `referenceImageUrl` when recreating a large hero or focal illustration from the design (see **Reference images**).
- Use **medium** quality for lineup photos, avatars, and card imagery.
- If generation fails, **retry** (including waiting longer for high-quality hero requests). Do not fall back to a cropped region of the design image as the shipped asset.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://diffui.ai/api/build/generate-image`

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "A portrait of a man for an avatar",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512,
  "quality": "medium"
}
```

**Required fields:**

- `authToken` — the same token from this build link (`6r1bcfJAIzlg`).
- `prompt` — plain-text description of the image (describe what you want; no negative prompts).
- `width` and `height` — **required** on every request. Choose dimensions explicitly for each asset.

**Optional fields:**

- `quality` — `"medium"` (default) or `"high"`. See **Choosing quality** below.
- `referenceImageUrl` — a Diffui image URL to use as a visual reference. **High quality (`"high"` / gpt-image-2) only.** See **Reference images** below.

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
```

Download the returned `url` to a local file (see **Local assets**), then reference that path in your HTML/CSS. Do not hotlink the remote URL. The auth token expires after seven days; if generation fails with 403, ask the user to re-copy the build link from Diffui.

To inspect a generated asset with a vision tool, download PNG the same way as design images (`&format=png` or a `.png` path suffix).

### Choosing quality

Pick `quality` per asset. **Default to medium** — it is faster, cheaper (1¢), and sufficient for most page assets.

| Use **medium** (default, 1¢) | Use **high** (13¢) |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Profile pictures, avatars | Large hero / banner images |
| Product shots, thumbnails | Anything needing ~2K resolution |
| Icons, small decorative images | Illustrations, artistic focal imagery |
| Most page assets | Main visual focus of the page |

**Medium example** (avatar):

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "Professional headshot portrait of a woman, neutral background",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512,
  "quality": "medium"
}
```

**High example** (hero illustration):

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "Wide cinematic illustration of a mountain landscape at sunset, painterly style",
  "width": 2048,
  "height": 1536,
  "quality": "high"
}
```

### Reference images (high quality only)

Use `referenceImageUrl` **only** when you need gpt-image-2 to recreate a **standalone background or illustration** that appears inside the design — not the full page screenshot.

**Use a reference image when:**

- The design shows a large hero illustration, scene, or photographic background that must become a real `<img>` or CSS background asset.
- You need a **full-resolution, isolated** version of that artwork (no navigation, buttons, headlines, or other UI chrome).
- A plain-text prompt alone would not preserve the composition, subjects, palette, or graphic details visible in the design.

**Do not use a reference image when:**

- Generating avatars, product shots, icons, thumbnails, or other assets that are **not** copied from a specific region of the design image.
- The asset is simple enough to describe accurately with `prompt` alone.
- You want to regenerate the **entire page** or any layout that includes UI elements — implement those in HTML/CSS from the design reference instead.

Pass a Diffui URL from this document (design image or a previously generated asset). The `authToken` in `referenceImageUrl` must match `authToken` in the request body. `referenceImageUrl` is rejected unless `quality` is `"high"`.

**High example** (isolated hero illustration from the design):

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "Recreate only the hero illustration from the reference: saxophonist in black suit and fedora against a New Orleans skyline, yellow sun disc, expressive JAZZ lettering, and purple brushstroke banner — no navigation, buttons, headlines, or page chrome. Match the reference composition, subjects, and color palette.",
  "width": 2048,
  "height": 1536,
  "quality": "high",
  "referenceImageUrl": "https://diffui.ai/image/Software_Projects_And_Articles.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
}
```

### Generation timing

- Each image request typically takes **around 60 seconds**; occasionally one can take **up to 3 minutes**.
- Wait for each request to finish before using its returned `url`.
- When you need **multiple assets**, send **separate requests in parallel** whenever you can (concurrent POSTs with different prompts and dimensions). Parallel generation is much faster than generating images one at a time.

### Medium quality (z-image) size rules

Used when `quality` is `"medium"` or omitted. Every `width`/`height` pair must satisfy all of:

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Minimum edge | 512 px |
| Maximum edge | 2048 px |
| Maximum aspect ratio | 3:1 (neither side more than 3× the other) |

**Sizing guidance:**

- **Avatars / icons / small squares:** **512×512**
- **Product shots / cards:** **512×768** or **768×512**
- **Medium landscape panels:** **1024×768**

Invalid dimensions return HTTP 400 with an error message.

### High quality (gpt-image-2) size rules

Used when `quality` is `"high"`. Every `width`/`height` pair must satisfy all of:

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Minimum edge | 16 px |
| Maximum edge | 2048 px |
| Multiple of | 16 |
| Maximum aspect ratio | 3:1 (neither side more than 3× the other) |
| Minimum total pixels | 655,360 |

**Sizing guidance:**

- **Avatars / icons / small squares:** use **816×816** (smallest valid square).
- **Landscape hero / banner:** **2048×1536**
- **Portrait hero:** **1536×2048**
- **Wide thumbnails:** e.g. **1280×512** (must still meet the pixel minimum)

Invalid dimensions return HTTP 400 with an error message. There is no default size — always specify `width` and `height` intentionally for each asset.

## Seamless background textures

When the design uses a **repeating photographic or organic surface** as a background (paper grain, linen, concrete, stone, fabric weave, subtle noise overlay), generate a seamless tile via Diffui — do not approximate with a cropped region from the design reference and do not use `build/generate-image` for textures.

**Generate a texture when:**

- The design shows a surface meant to tile with `background-repeat` (paper, linen, concrete, fabric, stone, film grain, etc.)
- A plain CSS color or gradient cannot faithfully reproduce the visible surface

**Do not generate a texture when:**

- The background is a flat solid color or a simple linear/radial gradient → use CSS
- The surface is glass, blur, or frosted effects → use CSS `backdrop-filter` or similar
- The asset is a hero photo, illustration, or product shot → use `build/generate-image`
- The pattern is a standard UI motif achievable with CSS alone

**Endpoint:** `POST https://diffui.ai/api/build/create-texture`

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "warm off-white paper grain, subtle fiber texture",
  "tilingMode": "both"
}
```

**Required fields:**

- `authToken` — the same token from this build link (`6r1bcfJAIzlg`).
- `prompt` — describe the surface or material only (what you want the tile to look like).

**Optional fields:**

- `tilingMode` — `"both"` (default), `"horizontal"`, or `"vertical"`. Use `"both"` for omnidirectional repeats. Use `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"` only when the design clearly repeats on one axis (e.g. horizontal wood slats or vertical fabric stripes).
- `maps` — optional array of PBR map types to generate alongside the seamless tile. Allowed values: `"basecolor"`, `"normal"`, `"roughness"`, `"metalness"`, `"height"`. Omit it or pass an empty array to use the Fal model default. **Only request specific maps when the user explicitly wants WebGL-style lighting or physically based shading** — not for standard CSS repeating backgrounds.

Example with a normal map for a lit 3D surface:

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "weathered brushed steel, fine directional scratches",
  "tilingMode": "both",
  "maps": ["normal", "roughness"]
}
```

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_texture.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024,
  "tilingMode": "both",
  "maps": [
    {
      "type": "normal",
      "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_texture_normal.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
    },
    {
      "type": "roughness",
      "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_texture_roughness.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
    }
  ]
}
```

When `maps` is omitted, Diffui omits the field from the Fal request so the model uses its default maps. If Fal returns map images, Diffui includes them in the `maps` response array.

Output is always **1024×1024**. Download the returned `url` locally (see **Local assets**), then reference that path in CSS:

| `tilingMode` | CSS `background-repeat` |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| `both` | `repeat` |
| `horizontal` | `repeat-x` |
| `vertical` | `repeat-y` |

- Cost: **3¢** per call for the seamless tile alone; **+1¢** per additional PBR map at 1024×1024 (e.g. tile + normal = 4¢).
- Typical workflow: identify the surface during design analysis → generate once → apply as a repeating CSS background. Request extra maps only for WebGL / Three.js materials with real-time lighting.

## Removing image backgrounds

When you need a transparent cutout (product on white, profile photo, logo), remove the background via Diffui after generating or sourcing the image. The endpoint accepts either a remote image URL (JSON) or a **local file uploaded directly** (multipart) — use the upload form for user-provided images that only exist on disk.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://diffui.ai/api/build/remove-background`

### Option A — remote image URL (JSON)

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "imageUrl": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
}
```

- `imageUrl` — a publicly fetchable image URL. Use a Diffui asset URL from `build/generate-image` (include the `authToken` query param).

### Option B — local file upload (multipart)

Send the file bytes directly as `multipart/form-data` — no hosting required:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://diffui.ai/api/build/remove-background" \
  -F "authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg" \
  -F "file=@assets/product-photo.png"
```

- `file` — the image file (PNG, JPEG, or WebP; max 25MB).
- Pass exactly one of `imageUrl` or `file`, not both.

**Required in both forms:**

- `authToken` — the same token from this build link.

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_cutout.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
```

- Cost: **1¢** per call.
- Typical workflow: generate with **medium** quality → remove background for product/profile cutouts.
- Download the returned `url` locally before using it in code (see **Local assets**).
- The returned image is a transparent PNG served as WebP for display; use `&format=png` when you need the alpha channel for inspection.

## Generating PBR maps from an image

When an existing image needs WebGL-style lighting — normal, height (displacement), roughness, basecolor (albedo), or metalness maps — generate the maps via Diffui. Use this for hero artwork, product cutouts, or any raster that will be lit in a shader. **Only call it when the user explicitly wants physically based lighting or displacement**, not for ordinary flat imagery.

Like remove-background, the input is either a remote URL (JSON) or a **local file uploaded directly** (multipart).

**Endpoint:** `POST https://diffui.ai/api/build/create-maps`

### Option A — remote image URL (JSON)

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "imageUrl": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "maps": ["normal", "height", "roughness"]
}
```

### Option B — local file upload (multipart)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://diffui.ai/api/build/create-maps" \
  -F "authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg" \
  -F "file=@assets/card.png" \
  -F "maps=normal,height,roughness"
```

**Required fields:**

- `authToken` — the same token from this build link.
- Exactly one of `imageUrl` (publicly fetchable URL) or `file` (PNG, JPEG, or WebP; max 25MB).

**Optional fields:**

- `maps` — which maps to predict: `"basecolor"`, `"normal"`, `"roughness"`, `"metalness"`, `"height"`. Omit to generate **all five**. Request only the maps your shader actually samples — cost scales per map.

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1536,
  "maps": [
    {
      "type": "normal",
      "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example_normal.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
    },
    {
      "type": "height",
      "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example_height.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
    },
    {
      "type": "roughness",
      "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example_roughness.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg"
    }
  ]
}
```

Maps match the input image dimensions and share its UV space — sample them with the same coordinates as the source texture.

- Cost: **1¢** base + **1¢ per megapixel per map** (e.g. a 1024×1024 input with all 5 maps = 6¢).
- Download each returned map `url` locally before referencing it (see **Local assets**); use `&format=png` when the shader pipeline needs lossless data.
- Unlike `build/create-texture` (which *generates a new seamless tile* from a text prompt), `build/create-maps` derives maps for an image you already have.

## Generating SVG assets

**Endpoint:** `POST https://diffui.ai/api/build/generate-svg`

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

Pick the mode by asset type — **do not use image-to-SVG for small UI icons**; vectorizing cropped icon pixels produces poor results. Use **text-to-SVG** for icons instead.

### Custom icons → text-to-SVG only

Use Quiver **text-to-SVG** for **non-standard icons** not available in your project's icon library — for example a ferris wheel for a county fair or a unique pictogram from the design.

**Do not generate SVGs for standard UI icons** (arrows, chevrons, menu, close, search, social logos, etc.). Use the icon pack your project already uses (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, Material Symbols, etc.).

**Do not use image-to-SVG for icons** — even with a tight crop from the design, results are usually unusable. Describe the icon in a `prompt` instead.

**Before generating:** search the icon pack for a close match. Only call `build/generate-svg` when no suitable icon exists.

Describe the icon in `prompt`. Optional `instructions` sets style (flat monochrome, line weight, etc.). **Always set `viewBox`** so the artwork fits the canvas and is not clipped. Use a square viewBox for icons (e.g. 64×64).

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "prompt": "Minimal ferris wheel icon for a county fair app, single-color line art",
  "instructions": "Flat monochrome icon. Draw entirely inside the viewBox with comfortable padding; do not extend past the canvas edges.",
  "viewBox": { "minX": 0, "minY": 0, "width": 64, "height": 64 }
}
```

### Complex illustrations → image-to-SVG only

Use **image-to-SVG** only for **large or complex artwork** that should become a vector illustration — for example a detailed logo mark, badge, or decorative graphic region from the design. **Not for footer icons, toolbar glyphs, or other small UI pictograms.**

1. Download the design as PNG (`&format=png`) and inspect it.
2. Measure the illustration's bounding box in pixels (not a tiny icon crop).
3. Fetch a crop around that region: `&format=png&crop=x,y,width,height` — no labels or neighboring UI unless they are part of the artwork.
4. Pass that URL as `imageUrl`. Use a viewBox that matches the illustration's aspect ratio and scale (e.g. 512×512 for a square logo).

```json
{
  "authToken": "6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "imageUrl": "https://diffui.ai/image/Hero.webp?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg&format=png&crop=400,80,640,480",
  "viewBox": { "minX": 0, "minY": 0, "width": 512, "height": 384 }
}
```

**Required fields:**

- `authToken` — the same token from this build link.
- Exactly one of `prompt` (text-to-SVG, **icons only**) or `imageUrl` (image-to-SVG, **illustrations only**).
- `viewBox` — SVG canvas forwarded to Quiver as `attributes.viewBox`. Set `minX` and `minY` to `0` unless you have a reason not to. Artwork must fit entirely inside this box with padding.

**Optional field:**

- `instructions` — text-to-SVG only; style guidance for Quiver. Mention that the icon must stay inside the viewBox.

**Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "url": "https://diffui.ai/image/generated_example.svg?authToken=6r1bcfJAIzlg",
  "width": 24,
  "height": 24
}
```

- Cost: **2¢** per SVG.
- Download the returned `url` locally before using it inline or as `<img src>` (see **Local assets**).
